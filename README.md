# DataStrcut_Assignment2 
I am posting this just for you to have a reference only, not for you to simply copy, and paste my answer in your assignment. 
If you have any problem, you can PM me on GitHub, but I only give you a guidance, and not provide an answer to you. Please keep that in mind.

Data Structures and algorithms need to practice more and think more so that you will quickly understand how it works. There is no shortcut for this and also almost everything.
